## 👋 Hi, I’m Marcin

### Software Developer / Engineer

I gained my first commercial experience at the age of 13 in 2012 by creating and programming my own Minecraft servers using Java. It was not only a great learning journey but also my first opportunity to earn money through programming. From that moment, I knew I wanted to become a developer who builds tools and solutions that make life easier for others.

Currently, I specialize in Java development, focusing on writing clean, efficient, and scalable code. I’m also eager to expand my skills by learning new programming languages such as Python, C++, and JavaScript.

### My interests:
- 🎮 Computer games — inspiring worlds and logical challenges  
- 🚗 Automotive — technology in motion  
- 🏅 Sports — persistence and passion

### Currently:
- 🔧 Working on Java projects with a focus on quality and efficiency  
- 📚 Exploring new languages and frameworks  
- 🤝 Open to collaboration and knowledge exchange
